**Step into a Captivating World**

> Explore the detailed 3D world with intricate level design, stunning visuals, and an eerie atmosphere that will keep you on edge. Unravel mysteries and immerse yourself in the chilling atmosphere of the haunted hotel.

**Learning through Adaptation**

> Driven by a love for stories and wanting to create immersive experiences, I learned from tutorials and experimented to create my own vision.

>I mastered the basics of Unity 3D, honed my C# scripting skills, and delved into game design. I used this knowledge to create a fully playable 3D stealth game, even though it follows the tutorial's structure and progression.

**My Unique Touch**

> Inspired by tutorials, i added some stories scattered around the place

**Work in Progress**

> Please note that the game is currently in an early playable state and may contain unfinished elements. However, it gives you a glimpse into the development process and shows the potential for improvement.

**Celebrating My Learning Journey**

> I'm proud to present this playable prototype, a testament to my dedication to learning and creating. Embark on this captivating adventure and experience the thrill of developing a game as a beginner.

**Future Updates**

> This project is still ongoing, and I plan to continue developing and refining the game based on feedback and further learning experiences. Stay tuned for updates and the release of the full game.
